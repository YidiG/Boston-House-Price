# Boston-House-Price Prediction

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to predict the median price of houses in Boston using linear regression. We aim to build a multi-linear regression model that can accurately estimate the median property value based on the dataset's 14 variables.

**Data Source:** The dataset used for this analysis is "Boston_Housing.csv," comprising 506 records with 14 variables. These variables include various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate, and others, which are relevant in determining the property prices in Boston.

**Methodology:**
1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned, and missing values are handled to ensure the quality of the data for regression analysis.
2. Feature Selection: We identify relevant features that have a significant impact on the median property value. This step helps in building an effective predictive model.
3. Multi-Linear Regression: The selected features are used to build a multi-linear regression model. The model aims to capture the relationships between the independent variables and the target variable (median property value) to make accurate predictions.
4. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, to assess its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting house prices.

**Report Summary:** The report outlines the process of predicting the median price of houses in Boston using a multi-linear regression model. It details the data preprocessing steps, feature selection, and the development of the regression model. The report also includes an in-depth analysis of the model's performance and accuracy metrics, providing insights into its effectiveness in estimating property values.

**Expected Outcome:** Through this analysis, we expect to develop a robust multi-linear regression model that accurately predicts the median price of houses in Boston based on the provided dataset. The model's predictive capabilities will offer valuable information to potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding property transactions in the Boston housing market.

**Significance:** The accurate prediction of house prices in Boston can significantly impact the real estate industry, helping buyers and sellers determine fair market values, negotiate better deals, and make informed investment decisions. Additionally, the model's insights can assist policymakers and urban planners in understanding housing market trends and formulating strategies for sustainable urban development.

By leveraging multi-linear regression, this project aims to contribute valuable information to the real estate domain and empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for making informed decisions in the dynamic Boston housing market.
